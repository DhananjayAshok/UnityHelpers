## Setup

Start by creating the following object heirarchy
```
playerObject (add playercontroller and rigidbody here)
└─── Model Root
    └─── Player model
└─── Camera Root
    └─── Camera Controls (Camera Controller here)
         └─── Camera Target (Marks ideal spot where you want camera to be relative to player)
              └─── Camera
```
